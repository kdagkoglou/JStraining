/*
TODO:
Create functions to:

1. Pretty print function. Given a date, return a readable string using the format "DD-MM-YYYY, HH:MM".
1. Day add function. Given a date and a positive or negative number, add that number to the day, i.e. -1 would return yesterday, 1 would return tomorrow.
1. Month start function. Given a date, return a new date matching midnight on the first day of month, e.g. 25-06-2018 would return 01-06-2018.
1. Month end function. Write a similar function which returns the last day of the month. (Hint: finding the first day of a month is simpler - could that be used to find the last?)
1. Start of week function. Given a date, return a new date matching midnight on the first Monday of that week, e.g. 28-01-18 would return 22-01-18.

Bonus point: dates are objects so they are passed to functions by reference (a pointer to the value rather than a copy of the value is passed). Try and make your functions **immutable**, i.e. the function result does not change the value of the input parameter.
