TODO:
Most social networks allow you to share a page without using their widgets. (Many of these are hundreds of Kb, slow the page, and introduce security/privacy issues.)

The links above would normally link you away from the current site. Create a system which intercepts a click on any social media link, then:

1. Modifies the URL to add the page {TITLE} (the <title> or first <h1> could do) and current URL. (Note this would often be done server-side in the template, but we'll presume this is a single-page app.)
2. Opens this URL in a centred 600 x 600 popup.

Hints:

* any number of social media links could be on the page - feel free to add IDs or classes as necessary.
* does the screen have room for a 600 x 600 popup?
* remember that, if a popup is successfully opened, the default click action must be prevented!
