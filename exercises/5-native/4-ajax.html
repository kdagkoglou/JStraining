TODO:
Create a multiple-choice quiz using this API:
https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=1&type=multiple

(more information at https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

The page should:

1. Call the API and show a question with four answers (ensure the correct answer is not in the same place every time).
2. When the user chooses an answer, they are told whether they are right or wrong and shown the correct answer if necessary.
3. They can then process to a new question.

Bonus points for:

1. Keeping score and/or showing statistics.
2. Adding a countdown timer for each question.
